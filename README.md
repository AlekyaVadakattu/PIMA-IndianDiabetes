# PIMA-IndianDiabetes

**Introduction:**

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset related to diabetes to develop accurate prediction models and gain insights into the factors influencing diabetes risk. The dataset contains information about pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin levels, BMI, genetic influence, age, and diabetes status. Through visual exploration and statistical modeling, the project aims to identify patterns and relationships among the variables. Classification models, including logistic regression and random forest, will be used to predict diabetes outcomes. The project aims to contribute to early detection, prevention, and management of diabetes by understanding the significant factors associated with the disease.
